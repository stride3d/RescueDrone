## Keys

- R: restart
- C: switch to free camera
- space: pause

## TODO

- [ ] Reenable Heat shimmering effect (under flying drone)
- [ ] Fix camera transition (key tangents should be set to constants)
- [ ] Background buildings were removed (redistribution not allowed). It would be good to see if we can put something else instead.
